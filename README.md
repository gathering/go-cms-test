# Gathering.org CMS tests

A collection of CMS demo setups on systems we are considering for new Gathering.org.

Each demo lives in a separate folder aptly named by which CMS and what type (mostly needed if we have multiple of same system) of demo it is.

Feel free to add more examples and documentation as needed.

## Current Content Management Systems being evaluated
